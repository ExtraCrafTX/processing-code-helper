This is a tool that adds several neat features to speed up programming in the Processing IDE.

### BracketCloser:

1. Closes brackets and quotation marks automatically.
2. Can wrap selection.

### AutoCompleter:

1. Can auto complete by pressing tab.
2. AutoCompletes can be modified in a file for customisation.

### Examples:

First run the tool from the tools menu. Then, type in "setup" and press tab. The tool will create the setup method for you! This works with any method name.
You can also, for example, select some text and hit left bracket. The text will automatically be wrapped!
